  description: "'The pathogenesis of chronic diseases: Common mechanisms at play? Critical transitions involved?'
  Many of the chronic, age related diseases such as cancer, metabolic or neurodegenerative diseases share certain hallmarks. These include evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory signatures or disturbances in proteostasis or secretory function. Chronic diseases can be looked at as perturbations of complex adaptive systems and are often characterized by critical transitions or catastrophic shifts. They have been studied intensively in theoretical and applied physics, ecology and economics. If we could understand the underlying mechanisms and the dynamics of critical transitions involved in the development of diseases, we would be better equipped to predict and eventual prevent them from arising.We have obtained evidence for a key role a familial Parkinsonâ€™s disease gene, as a regulator of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), influencing the ability of a cell to switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Based on the central nature of this switch in cellular and energy metabolism, I will present a hypothesis and potential explanation for the concomitant increase in the prevalence of different chronic diseases and their comorbidities, including neuropsychiatric diseases. Maybe we can discuss together how we could identify and characterize critical transitions in these disease process."

  description: "On the mathematical modelling and high-throughput bulk and single-cell data
Experimental approaches such as single-cell and bulk sequencing, mass spectrometry and imaging provide nowadays an immense amount of quantitative data. This renders data analysis, including integration and interpretation, more relevant than ever before. However, data analysis is often computationally intensive and many approaches are not scalable.
In this talk, I will present some of our recent work on model-based data analysis. I will focus on: (1) methods for the analysis of multi-omics data from cancer cell lines using large-scale cancer pathway models; and (2) approaches for the interpretation of single-cell imaging and sequencing data using population models. In these application areas, I will outline (reusable) methodological advancement which significantly improved the scalability and applicability of approaches."

  description: "Rapid technological progress in biomedical sciences is continuously raising questions regarding efficient and valid statistical analyses and interpretation of experimental data. Although a multitude of computational approaches have been developed, the analysis and interpretation of data is still a bottleneck. One reason is that the performance of computational methods is often context-specific and application limits are widely unknown. 
We established a comprehensive statistical methodology for mathematical modelling in the systems biology. Moreover, we are developing computational and statistical approaches for analyzing high-throughput data. In this talk, I will discuss the profile likelihood as a general concept for uncertainty analyses. Moreover, a new modelling approach will be presented which is tailored to describing the dynamics of individual cellular compounds and is applicable to high-throughput data. In addition, new concepts for benchmarking of computational algorithms will be presented. These concepts are discussed based on two examples: methods for imputation of missing values in proteomics, and identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from sequencing data.
